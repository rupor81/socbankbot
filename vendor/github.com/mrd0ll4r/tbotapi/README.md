# TBotAPI - Telegram Bot-API for Go #

This is a simple wrapper for the Telegram Bot-API for Go.
It provides a high-level API in Go that works with the Telegram REST API.

The implementation is pretty raw, i.e. you will just send and receive messages - you have to handle any command parsing or stuff yourself.

### How do I get set up? ###

A simple

    go get -u github.com/mrd0ll4r/tbotapi

should do it.

### Example ###

See `examples/` for some simple bots.
Start with the echo bot.

### API-stableness ###

Is the API stable? **No**

Why is the API not stable?
Because Telegram changes its bot API frequently.
We try to only add things, not remove them.
So everything you did with this library before should also work after API changes.

**Exception**: I did one major overhaul so far, where I removed the model package and unified most sending methods.
I'm pretty happy with the architecture so far, so I hope I won't have to do that again.

### What do we use? ###

We use

* [resty] for REST calls
